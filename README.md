# RoleClass-Smod2-Plugin

## What is it?
RoleClass is a plugin that lets you assign items to a certain role.

## How do I configure it?
Navigate to your `config_gameplay.txt` file, and put the following in (anywhere):
Config Option | Value Type | Default | Description
--- | :---: | :---: | ---
k_roleclass | Dictionary | **EMPTY** | Use this config option to set the name of your role whatever items you want. NOTE: Affects globally (doesn't matter the class).

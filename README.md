# RoleClass-Smod2-Plugin

## What is it?
RoleClass is a plugin that lets you assign items to a certain role.

## How do I configure it?
Navigate to your `config_gameplay.txt` file, and put the following in (anywhere):

| Config Option  | Type | Default | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| k_global_give  | Dictionary  | **EMPTY** | Use this config option to give any role whatever item you want. Format: `role:item#`. A list of items is available on the Smod discord. NOTE: Affects globally (doesn't matter the class).
